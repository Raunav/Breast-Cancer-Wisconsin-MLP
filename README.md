# Breast-Cancer-Wisconsin-MLP
This project implements a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model to classify breast cancer diagnoses using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The project evaluates the model's performance using 5-fold cross-validation and analyzes its learning curves to detect overfitting.

## Project Overview
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is used to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The dataset features 30 real-valued input attributes derived from digital scans of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

## Key Features
- Implementation of an MLP model using Python and sklearn.
- Plotting and analysis of learning curves to identify overfitting.
- Evaluation of the model using 5-fold cross-validation for performance assessment.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- sklearn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results
- **5-fold Cross-validation**: The model achieves high average testing accuracy across folds, showcasing its predictive performance.
- **Learning Curves**: Visual inspection of learning curves reveals insights into the model's ability to generalize and helps refine the model parameters.

## Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29).
